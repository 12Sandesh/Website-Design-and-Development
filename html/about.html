        <h2 class="qn">What is anime?</h2>
        <p class="ans">Anime is the word Western audiences use to describe Japanese film animation and TV shows (although it’s used to describe any animation in Japan itself). The medium’s low production costs and proliferation in Japanese popular culture mean anime is produced in a variety of genre, from high-school comedy-drama to post-apocalyptic sci-fi and horror. Known for its expressive characters and relatively limited animation, anime has pushed boundaries, captivated audiences - and even won an Oscar.

    <div class="block">
        <h2 class="qn">Anime vs animation</h2>
        <p class="ans">Despite sharing common etymology there are differences between anime and animation in the way the two styles portray movement, character and background.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="ans">Range of motion</li>
                <li class="space">We use the word ‘animated’ to describe a person who just can’t sit still. And much of the animation technique is about how characters move from point A to point B, using key frames and straight-ahead animation to emphasise the sometimes chaotic nature of a character’s movement. But in anime there’s much less focus on animating movement. While there tends to be some exaggeration in facial expressions and reflex actions, particularly in children’s shows like the Pokémon series, generally the animations are much less hectic, with more defined, orderly interactions between characters and slower, more considered movement.</li>

                <li class="ans">Scenes and settings</li>
                <li class="space">One of anime’s most visually appealing aspects is its focus on scenery and background. Anime emphasises the mises-en-scène more than the players - packing in the preamble with detailed backgrounds, relying more on sound and visual effects to promote whatever atmosphere the following scene calls for.On the other hand, animation focuses very much on the foreground - even at the expense of the background. Sometimes a background would be ‘wrapped’ to repeat itself in older animation works as, for example, the cast of Scooby-Doo fled their monster of the week through unnaturally stretched-out corridors and identical patches of forest.
                </li>

                <li class="ans">Target audiences</li>
                <li class="space">Strictly adult-orientated programming has maintained a small presence throughout the history of animation, with outliers like Fritz the Cat and Heavy Metal alongside more mainstream fare.
                However, the medium has predominantly belonged to families and specifically younger viewers in the West. Anime, on the other hand, has never discriminated.</li>
                <li  class="space">A studio’s typical production docket can easily contain comedic character-based studies with dark dystopian drama. Not to mention the near-hundred-billion-dollar juggernaut that is Pokémon, plus its peers keeping kids entertained.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="qn">Anime vs manga:</h2>
        <p class="ans">A term we closely associate with anime is manga, however the two are distinctly different art forms.
            The same difference between comic books and cartoons applies to manga and anime. Manga deals with stories on the printed page, 
            while anime is the animated variety of storytelling. Manga are a rich source of culture throughout Japan, from bestselling works
            and serialised stories to self-published zines and grassroots movements.
            <br> <br>
            Western confusion between the two terms partly stems from the popular Manga Entertainment company. In an earlier guise, 
            this was the company that broke the sci-fi anime phenomenon Akira in the UK during the early 1990s. 
            <br> <br>
            The company’s preference for distributing titles on the edgier side of the anime spectrum like Fist of the North Star and
            Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend was partly what gave Manga (the company) and anime (the medium) a cooler, more grown-up 
            reputation in the West. 
            <br> <br>
            But the name itself was a misnomer: Manga distributed anime titles and rarely printed comic books despite ‘manga’ specifically 
            referring to comics and graphic novels. 
            <br> <br>
            However, just as Hollywood has a penchant for adapting bestselling books to the big screen, so too do many of manga’s most popular
            works make it into animated productions both for TV and film. Death Note, Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon are just three of the most 
            recognised titles in the West which began life on the hand-drawn page.

        <h2 class="qn">Examples of anime</h2>
        <p class="eg">Anime productions are categorised by viewers and makers alike in terms of their target audience. Here are just a 
            few of the types of anime.
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="eg">Kodomo/Kodomuke</li>
                <li class="gap">-anime aimed at children. Examples include the various Pokémon series, as well as Hello Kitty and Digimon. 
                    They tend to have little life lessons, are gender neutral and characterised by diverse casting. 
                </li>
                <li class="eg">Shónen</li>
                <li class="gap">- aimed at pre-teen and teenage boys. Dragon Ball and Naruto are popular examples of shónen, characterised
                    by young men in leader positions, lots of action and being quite wide-reaching in the types of genre.
                </li>
                <li class="eg">Shójo</li>
                <li class="gap">- aimed at pre-teen and teenage girls. Sailor Moon and Fushigi Yuugi are popular titles. 
                    These typically deal a lot more with romance and relationships, although some have their fair share of action too.
                </li>
                <li class="eg">Seinen</li>
                <li class="gap">- aimed at young adult men. Tend to contain more adult themes, with science fiction and horror genre prominent. 
                    Examples include Hellsing, One-Punch Man and Tokyo Ghoul.
                </li>
                <li class="eg">Josei</li>
                <li class="gap">aimed at young adult women. Takes a more realistic, adult approach to relationships and romance, with adult
                    themes and psychological depths. Examples include Usagi Drop and Paradise Kiss.
                </li>

        <h2 class="qn">Anime FAQs.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="eg">What is the longest anime?</li>
                <li class="eg">The longest-running anime production in the world is Sazae-san. Based on the manga written and illustrated by 
                    Machiko Hasegawa since 1946, the anime series of eight-minute episodes began airing in 1969. Fifty years and some 8,000 
                    segments later, the family-based comedy is still going strong. Its prominent placement on Sunday nights has even given 
                    rise to ‘Sazae-san syndrome’, that old feeling that the weekend is almost over once it's aired.
                </li>
                <li class="eg">What is the true meaning of anime?</li>
                <li class="eg">Although thought to derive from the French for ‘cartoon’, dessin animé, anime is merely a shortened expression
                        of the English word ‘animation’, written as ‘animéshon’ in Japanese katakana as アニメーション. While in the Western world
                        it’s used particularly to describe Japanese-produced works, the word in Japan covers the whole world of animation.
